# odin-recipes

Goal:
This is a simple recipes HTML project utilizing links and images. The main purpose of this project is not the project itself, but instead, practicing with the command line, got commits, and uploading a final project to github. 

Self-reflection:
After iteration 1, I was following along with the git basics prompt and part of using the command terminal stated that "Add index.html" after the git commit. I initially thought that this was a command, and so I was struggling with finding out how to add git commit subjects and comments. However after re reading the git commits section I realized that the area in quotation marks was the git comment. 
I found when working on iteration 2 that I can undo a git commit since I messed up a comment by not putting the closing quotation marks.I can undo the commit by doing git reset --soft HEAD~1 
Iteration 3 went rather smoothly and my confidence is building.
