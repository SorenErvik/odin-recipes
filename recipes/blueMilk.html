        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Blue milk,[13] also known as Bantha milk,[14] was a rich blue-colored milk produced by female banthas. Sentients drank it,[12] and also used it in bantha butter,[7] blue bantha buttermilk biscuits,[9] blue-milk cheese,[10] blue milk custard, ice cream, and yogurt.[12] It was notably available on Outer Rim planets such as Batuu,[1] Lah'mu,[2] Lothal,[3] and Tatooine.[4] Cid's Parlor on Ord Mantell served a similar beverage that was alcoholic called Dark Blue Milk.[15]</p>

        <p>During a lightsaber training session, the young Ezra Bridger had to protect himself as the astromech droid Chopper kept lobbing cartons of blue milk at him.[13] Two establishments in Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, served blue milk or blue milk-based concoctions; Milk Stand sold blue milk and an alcoholic Blue Milk Cooler,[11] while Oga's Cantina served the non-alcoholic Blue Bantha.[8]</p>
